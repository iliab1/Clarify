## Overview
Clarify is a Streamlit application for fact-checking claims in text, powered by OpenAI and Google's Custom Search API. 
It works in three main steps:
1. **Extracts** atomic and unambiguous claims from the input,
2. **Verifies** claims against information on the web,
3. **Provides** a verdict (True, False, or Uncertain) with detailed explanations and sources.
